/*
* NOTE: we assume all LAs have maxNeighbours, which makes all agent's Data of a same,
* definite size after the network is initialized.
* 
* TO DO: Rework the structures : )
* TO DO: use fixed width types!
* 
1) Each LA's data will be comprised of:

TO DO: COLD:
-A name (of fixed maximum size); 

TO DO: STATE:
-On/off boolean, to signal whether it should be taken in account or ignored by the system (say, because the location has been destroyed);
-A position;
-A quantity of resources and its update rate;
-A strength;
-The id of the GA it belongs to, if any;
-The information about which LAs it's connected to (as a bitfield);
-A list of the disposition towards each connected LA (can be positive or negative);
-The diplomatic stance towards each connected LA (eg: hostile, neutral, trade, ally);

TO DO: DECISION:
-A list of how much information it has on each connected LA;
-A list of LA-decision-related thresholds, which act as the "personality" of the agent;
-A list of active constraints/incentives given by the associated GA;
TO DO: -Strength threshold to start costing upkeep and current upkeep;
TO DO: -A list of the expected values, for each neighbor, of:
        resources, income, strenght, diplomacy and relations to this LA.
		TO DO: should evaluate personality and priorities as well? LEANING NO (NOT NOW)
TO DO: -Desires, Impediments and Potential Actions Data;

2) Each GA's data will be comprised of:

TO DO: COLD:
-A name (of fixed maximum size);

TO DO: STATE:
-On/off, as in the LAs;
-The information about which LAs belong to it (as a bitfield);
-The information about which other GAs itâ€™s connected to (as a bitfield);
-GA resources (used to pay for Actions, acquired as % of LA incomes);
-A list of the disposition towards each connected GA (can be positive or negative);
-The diplomatic stance towards each connected GA (eg: hostile, neutral, trade, ally);
-Total resources and accumulation rates of the connected LAs;
-Total strength of the connected LAs.

TO DO: DECISION:
-A list of how much information it has on each connected GA;
-Four traits (4 ids), which will influence the GAs "personality";
TO DO: -A list of the expected values, for each neighbor, of:
       GA resources, totals, diplomacy and relations.
TO DO: -Desires, Impediments and Potential Actions Data;
