1) Each LA's data will be comprised of:
 
-On/off boolean, to signal whether it should be taken in account or ignored by the system (say, because the location has been destroyed);
-A position;
-A name (of fixed maximum size);
-A quantity of resources and its update rate;
-A strength and a strength threshold to start costing upkeep;
-The current upkeep;
-The id of the GA it belongs to, if any;
-The information about which LAs it's connected to (as a bitfield);
-A list of the disposition towards each connected LA (can be positive or negative);
-The diplomatic stance towards each connected LA (eg: hostile, neutral, trade, ally);
-A list of how much information it has on each connected LA;
-A list of LA-decision-related thresholds, which act as the "personality" of the agent;
-A list of active constraints/incentives given by the associated GA.

2) Each GA's data will be comprised of:

-On/off, as in the LAs;
-A name (of fixed maximum size);
-The information about which LAs belong to it (as a bitfield);
-The information about which other GAs itâ€™s connected to (as a bitfield);
-A list of the disposition towards each connected GA (can be positive or negative);
-The diplomatic stance towards each connected GA (eg: hostile, neutral, trade, ally);
-A list of how much information it has on each connected GA;
-Four traits (4 ids), which will influence the GAs "personality";
-Total resources and accumulation rates of the connected LAs;
-Total strength of the connected LAs.
